// Write your code here
let num1 = 31;

let multiply = num1 * num2;           // that will multiply the variables num1 and num2 whose results will equal "62".
let random              // that will generate a random integer greater than 0.
let mod                // set to an equation whose remainder is equal to "4".
let max               // that will return "20" as the highest number in the set.
