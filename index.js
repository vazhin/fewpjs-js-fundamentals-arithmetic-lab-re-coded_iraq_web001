// Write your code here
let num1 = 31;
let num2 = 2;

let multiply = num1 * num2;           // that will multiply the variables num1 and num2 whose results will equal "62".
let random = Math.floor(Math.random() * 10) + 1;              // that will generate a random integer greater than 0.
let mod = 29 % 5;                // set to an equation whose remainder is equal to "4".
let max = Math.max(2,6,1,9,20,4);               // that will return "20" as the highest number in the set.
